# Pokemon Info Fetcher

In this repository, I've learnt how to do API requests, Pillow, and I also explored customTikinter in python!~~


# Project Preview
It's pretty crude looking...

Here I struck a 'Exception Thrown', before I tried to add sprites to the appâ€”The part where it checks for valid pokemons still works... I do have a clue on how to fix it
but if only I had time... I'll come back to this in the future probably on sunday

# Part where I struggled!

  I struggled in trying to find a way to have all the abilities of the pokemon to be shown, thought after a few tries I realized I just need to add a for loop.
  I struggled to fix the issue that I stated above, I dont have much time to fix it unfortunately. I was thinking of using another if statement to check for validity similar to the one above the error.
  
  The project was simple so I couldnt list a lot of parts where I actually struggled to solve.

# Why did I make this?

  It was mainly to learn API requests and I wanted to explore customTkinter for abit~ 

# Final Thoughts
  This project was lots of fun to make!
  I'm also trying to make the habit of adding comments to explain parts of the code and
  the naming for the variables could've be better.
  I should've made the logic for the submit button way more robust and actually work but having to balance this and school is hard.
